# ground-maps

This repository is intended to contain code to display all the football grounds attended on an interactive Google Maps display. It contains my own personal data on my somewhat stalled quest to join the [92 club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_92_Club).

The plan was to take a raw csv list of the grounds, which includes data such as the location and the match witnessed, use Java code to parse it into compatible JSON, and then use JavaScript to load the information necessary to display it on Google Maps.

Since starting this project, Google have started billing for the use of Maps, so it may be necessary to look elsewhere for a suitable mapping platform.
